# Racket Solution by Diego Crespo

Racket is a programming language based on the Scheme Dialect of Lisp. It supports a superset of the [R6RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)#R6RS) Scheme standard. Highlights include...

1. A gradually typed sister language called [Typed Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/index.html).
2. A built in [Cross platform GUI library](https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/).
3. Ability to [create standalone executables](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe.html).
4. First class support for Domain Specific Languages, and [entirely new programming langages](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/getting-started.html#%28part._first-example%29) built on top of Racket with alternate syntaxes through the use of #lang your-lang.
5. Thorough documentation of the entire language, both in a [lighter introduction](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/) a more [comprehensive reference](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/) and [introduction with pictures](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/) for younger audiences
6. No fuss [download](https://download.racket-lang.org/)
7. A [package manager](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/index.html) and [browsable package index](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/)
